<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect
    your information when you use our Android application.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>We believe in "privacy by design." We only collect the minimum amount of data necessary to
    provide and improve our services:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Authentication Data:</strong> When you sign in, we collect your <strong>email
        address</strong>. This is used solely to identify you as a user and manage your account
        security.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Anonymous Analytics:</strong> We collect anonymous usage data (such as feature
        usage, crash reports, and device type). This information does not contain any personally
        identifiable information (PII) and cannot be linked back to you.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
<p>The data we collect is used for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>To provide and maintain the service (authentication).</li>
    <li>To monitor the performance of the app and fix technical issues.</li>
    <li>To understand aggregate user trends and improve the overall experience.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
<p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your email address or usage data to outside parties.
    Your email address is strictly used for the core functionality of the app.</p>

<h2>4. Security</h2>
<p>We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your email address during
    transmission and storage. However, please remember that no method of electronic storage or
    transmission over the internet is 100% secure.</p>

<h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>Our app may use third-party analytics providers (e.g., Google Analytics for Firebase) to help us
    understand app usage. These services collect data anonymously. We encourage you to review their
    respective privacy policies.</p>

<h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting
    the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
